# js_sudoku

This is a jsr package to create and solve sudoku boards.

### Quickstart
Running `main.ts` will use a depth first search algorithm 
with pruning to generate a random solved sudoku board. 

```js
deno main.ts
```

### ToDo:  
Add dancing links algorithm to solve sudoku boards as 
efficiently as possible & add functions to both dancing 
link and dfs_prune that generate valuid sudoku boards, 
not just solutions.
